The project is in Elixir. It needs Elixar to be installed. -> http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html

1. Once done, unpack the project contents and go to banking dir.
2. Then execute mix test to run tests.


Tests cover
Deposit
Withdrawal
GetBalance

Each test asserts above tasks are done properly and the balance reflects correctly.

There is test for server, server_chain

To run demo use mix run lib/banking.ex <path of config file>

Elixir is a completely functional language for building distributed fault tolerant applications. It basically runs on an Erlang VM. So, a lot of paradigms and libraries are borrowed from Erlang. 

At a high level, the code is similar to the pseudocode and the language is quite expressive.

**Cons**
- The error reporting mechanism of the language is quite primitive which makes debugging a strenuous task.
- Since the language is completely functional without any Object oriented features, state management has to be done withing a process and this makes modelling real world applications cumbersome. No information is cached and needs to be sent from one method to another.
- Looping constructs are primitive. There are no normal 'for' and 'while' loops. It contains alternatives called generators which iterate on enumerables to produce a new enumerable. Within these generators it is not possible to modify any variable, which is again a side-effect of completely functional programming. This shortcoming was countered by implementing our own versoin of looping using a recursive function.

**Pros**
- It is build for building distributed applications. Hence contructs for creating processes and handling inter-process communication are taken care of.
- A number of light-weight processes can be spawned and their process tree can be managed.
- Contains libraries for server level abstractions.
- Readability of the code is quite good and it is very similar to Ruby, which is known for its elegance as far as readability is concerned. It is possible to contain a lot of logic within small piece of code.
